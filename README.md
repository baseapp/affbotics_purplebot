## Introduction
Purple Bot is a versatile and educational small robot designed for learners of all ages. It measures 90mm x 90mm and includes a small breadboard on top to facilitate experimentation beyond basic sensors. Inspired by the BoeBot and Arduino Alvik , Purple Bot is ideal for a range of users, from kids to advanced college students.

It is capable of running on it own based on it stm32g030 Controller or running as a slave to a more power controllers like ESP32 , RP2040 or Microbit. You may also design a shield to add your own controller type.
